# Insurance Claims - Fraud Detection

## Business case:

### Insurance fraud is a huge problem in the industry. It's difficult to identify fraud claims. 

### In this project, we work with some auto insurance data to demonstrate how we can create a predictive model that predicts if an insurance claim is fraudulent or not. This is a Binary Classification task, and we will be creating various Tree-based models.
